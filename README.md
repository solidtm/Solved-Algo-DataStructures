This project contains a collection of algorithm and data structure questions I've been able to solve, in Java, Javascript and Kotlin.

I use it for learning purposes. Used https://www.visualgo.net to visualize the common behaviour of some data structures. Feel free to use that too.

Also, feel free to send a PR with modifications, corrections and ideas on how to improve on the time and space complexity.

It would be nice if you could add some more questions you'd like me to try to solve into the 'questions folder'.

Enjoy!!! :)
