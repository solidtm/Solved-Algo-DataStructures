# Algorithms and Data Structures

This project contains a collection of algorithm and data structure questions I've been able to solve, in Java and Kotlin.

I use it for learning purposes.

Feel free to send a PR with modifications, corrections and ideas on how to improve on the time and space complexity.

It would be nice if you could add some more questions you'd like me to try to solve into the 'questions folder'.

Enjoy!!! :)
