//    Problem
//
//    We have houses along a street. Street is divided into block, and each house is located in a single block.
//    We need to allocate k mailboxes to the street in a way that total distance between house and mailboxes are minimum.
//
//    The house's locations are given as a list of integer. For example, [3,5,7] means that houses are located in block 3, block 5, block 7.
//    The number of mailboxes to allocate, k, is also given as an input. when k is 2, you need to allocate 2 mailboxes in the street.
//    Given a list of integers representing the block numbers of houses, and the number of mailbox, determine the minimum total distance from each house to mailbox.
//
//    Example 1:
//    Input: houses = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 3
//    Output: 5
//    Explanation: we can allocate mailbox in block 5, block 10, and somewhere in between 15 and 20, let's say 17.
//    Then total distance will be (5-5) + (10-10) + (17-15) + (20-17) = 5.

//    Example 2:
//    Input: houses = [6, 7, 8, 12], k = 2
//    Output: 2
//    Explanation: we can allocate mailbox in block 7, and block 12.
//    Then total distance will be (7-6) + (7-7) + (8-7) + (12-12) = 2.

//    Example 3:
//    input: houses = [3, 5, 6, 8], k = 1
//    Output: 6
//    Explanation: If we put mailbox in block 5 or block 6, total distance will be 6.

//    Example 4:
//    Input: houses = [8, 12, 17], k = 3
//    Output: 0
//    Explanation: Put mailbox in block 8, 12, 17, then total distance will be 0.
